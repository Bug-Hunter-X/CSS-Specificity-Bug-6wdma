The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling outcomes.  For instance, consider the following scenario:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myElement {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myElement {
  color: green;
}

<div id="myElement" class="myElement"></div>
```

The element will be green because the ID selector has higher specificity than the class selector, but the combined selector (`#myElement.myElement`) has higher specificity than both of the individual selectors.  This is not always immediately obvious and can cause significant frustration when troubleshooting.
